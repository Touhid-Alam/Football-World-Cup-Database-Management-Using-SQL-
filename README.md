<h1 align = center> Football World Cup Database Management System</h1>
<p align=justify>The FIFA Football World Cup Management System is a structured database designed to manage and organize all essential information related to the teams, players, matches, stadiums, referees, coaches, and statistics associated with the tournament. Each team is uniquely identified by a TEAM ID and includes information on the team's rank, statistics, and coaching staff. Teams play numerous matches, each with distinct match details, including the competing teams, winner, loser, date, and venue. Stadiums, where matches are held, are identified by unique IDs and include data on location, capacity, and match history.

Additionally, the system tracks referees, each with a unique ID and details on their officiating history. Coaches and players are also managed within the system, with each player having detailed statistics and specialty information. Team captains, player stats, and individual player specializations are further recorded, allowing for comprehensive data analysis and efficient management of the tournament. This robust system enables organizers to seamlessly monitor and manage the intricate details involved in hosting a world-class football event.</p>
